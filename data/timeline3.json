      "text": "<p>The economic boom of the 1960s brought hundreds of thousands of migrant workers to Switzerland. Rapid population growth pushed the infrastructure to its limits and xenophobic tendencies spread to right-wing and trade unionist circles. The Federal Council's reluctance to regulate labour migration also contributed to the fact that the advocates of the second \"alienation initiative\" had good chances at the ballot box. In order to avert this rigorous and anti-growth restriction of immigration, the Federal Council issued a more economically acceptable \"limitation of the number of foreigners\" (global ceiling) on 16 March 1970.</p>"
